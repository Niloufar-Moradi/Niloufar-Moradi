 - In this research, we propose an aspect-based sentiment classification technique that predicts the sentiment polarity of various aspects within Persian sentences using a Persian language dataset. With a multi-head attention mechanism and a dynamic masking method, we have developed a method that focuses on local context in addition to global context features. To capture long-term dependencies, a BERT layer is also used.
